NMEA Message Structure

To understand the NMEA message structure, let’s examine the popular $GPGGA message. This particular message was output from an RTK GPS receiver:

$GPGGA,181908.00,3404.7041778,N,07044.3966270,
W,4,13,1.00,495.144,M,29.200,M,0.10,0000*40

All NMEA messages start with the $ character, and each data field is separated by a comma.

GP represent that it is a GPS position (GL would denote GLONASS).

181908.00 is the time stamp: UTC time in hours, minutes and seconds.

3404.7041778 is the latitude in the DDMM.MMMMM format. Decimal places are variable.

N denotes north latitude.

07044.3966270 is the longitude in the DDDMM.MMMMM format. Decimal places are variable.

W denotes west longitude.

4 denotes the Quality Indicator:

1 = Uncorrected coordinate

2 = Differentially correct coordinate (e.g., WAAS, DGPS)

4 = RTK Fix coordinate (centimeter precision)

5 = RTK Float (decimeter precision.

13 denotes number of satellites used in the coordinate.

1.0 denotes the HDOP (horizontal dilution of precision).

495.144 denotes altitude of the antenna.

M denotes units of altitude (eg. Meters or Feet)

29.200 denotes the geoidal separation (subtract this from the altitude of the antenna to arrive at the Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE).

M denotes the units used by the geoidal separation.

1.0 denotes the age of the correction (if any).

0000 denotes the correction station ID (if any).

*40 denotes the checksum.

The $GPGGA is a basic GPS NMEA message. There are alternative and companion NMEA messages that provide similar or additional information.
